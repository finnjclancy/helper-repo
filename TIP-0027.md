## Abstract

This TIP proposes the implementation of enhanced user authentication mechanisms within the Talos framework to improve security and user experience. The proposal outlines the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometric verification methods as standard practices for all user accounts.

## Motivation

As cyber threats continue to evolve, traditional password-based authentication methods are no longer sufficient to ensure account security. By implementing enhanced authentication methods, we can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and improve overall user confidence in the platform.

## Specification

The proposed enhancements include:
1. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):
   - Users will be required to provide two or more verification factors to access their accounts.
   - Supported methods: SMS-based codes, email verification, authentication apps, and hardware tokens.

2. Biometric Verification:
   - Integration of fingerprint and facial recognition technology for mobile and desktop applications.
   - User data will be stored securely and processed in compliance with privacy regulations.

3. User Education:
   - Provision of resources and guides for users on the importance of secure authentication practices.

## Rationale

Enhancing user authentication aligns with best practices in cybersecurity and addresses current vulnerabilities associated with single-factor authentication. Implementing MFA and biometric options not only increases security but also accommodates diverse user preferences, making the platform more accessible.

## Security Considerations

The proposal prioritizes user data privacy and security. All biometric data will be processed on-device wherever possible to minimize risk, and proper encryption will be employed for all communications involved in authentication processes.

## Implementation

The implementation will be phased:
1. Develop the core MFA architecture and integrate it into the existing user management system.
2. Pilot the biometric option with a select group of users to assess performance and user feedback.
3. Roll out comprehensive user documentation and support for gradual adoption across the user base.
