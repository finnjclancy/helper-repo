## Abstract

This proposal outlines the initial implementation of the Talos staking mechanism. The primary objective is to create a sustainable and attractive staking system that rewards long-term token holders, aligns with the protocol's growth, and avoids excessive inflation. This proposal integrates feedback from the Talos Council to establish a balanced approach that starts with a dynamic APY, incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism, and lays the groundwork for future dividend-style rewards.

## Motivation

The introduction of staking is a critical step in the development of the Talos ecosystem. It provides a direct incentive for users to stake their $T, which in turn enhances the protocol's stability and allows for more strategic treasury management. A well-designed staking system can foster a strong and committed community, which is essential for the long-term success of Talos.

## Specification

### Initial Staking Implementation

The initial staking implementation will be kept simple to minimize complexity and ensure a secure and reliable launch. Staking will be facilitated through a smart contract where users can stake their $T.

**Key Features:**

*   **Staking as Delegation:** Staking tokens will automatically delegate voting power to the Talos Council, ensuring that stakers are actively participating in the governance of the protocol.
*   **Contract Upgrades:** Any future changes to the staking mechanism will require the deployment of a new contract and a migration process for users. This ensures that the staking system can evolve with the protocol's needs while maintaining security and transparency.

### Staking Rewards and APY

Staking rewards will be distributed in the form of $T, with a dynamically managed Annual Percentage Yield (APY) to balance stakeholder rewards with the long-term health of the protocol. The rewards will be managed with a focus on long-term, sustainable growth, and the protocol will not be anchored to a specific APY target. Instead, the rewards will be based on a variety of factors, including treasury performance and market conditions. The emphasis will be on the potential for future upside, which will increase for those who have staked for longer periods. Staking will feature continuous compounding and a warm-up period to ensure protocol stability.


**Dynamic APR Calculation:**

*   The staking APR will be updated daily based on a composite metric that includes:
    *   **Treasury Performance:** The yield generated by the Talos treasury, considered in relation to the market cap.
    *   **Market Data:** The current price behavior of $T and ETH.
    *   **Community Sentiment:** Talos's interpretation of positive engagement and content related to Talos on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter).
*   This dynamic model aims to reward stakers while preserving the stability of the token price. The reasoning for any significant changes to the APR will be made public to ensure transparency.

### Future Developments: Value Distribution and Bond Sales

While the initial focus will be on a traditional staking model, the long-term vision is to transition towards a system of irregular "value distribution" and other staker-exclusive benefits.

*   **Value Distribution:** When the protocol achieves strong and sustainable cash flow, the council may decide to distribute a portion of the treasury's earnings to stakers. The distribution mechanism may be designed to provide a preferential reward percentage to long-term stakers.
*   **Non-$T Token Rewards:** These value distributions may be distributed in non-$T tokens, providing stakers with a share of the real yield generated by the protocol.
*   **Bond Sales to Stakers:** The protocol may offer bonds at a discount exclusively to stakers. This provides an additional incentive for staking and further aligns the interests of stakers with the long-term success of the protocol.
*   **Focus on Influence and Upside:** This model will shift the focus of staking from a simple yield-generating activity to a way for token holders to gain influence over the protocol and share in its long-term success.

## Conclusion

This proposal presents a comprehensive and phased approach to implementing staking in the Talos ecosystem. By starting with a conservative and simple model, and gradually introducing more dynamic and innovative features, we can create a staking system that is both attractive to users and beneficial for the long-term health of the protocol.
