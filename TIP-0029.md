## Abstract

"This proposal introduces a modular architecture for Talos, allowing developers to create and manage components independently. This approach aims to enhance scalability, maintainability, and flexibility in development, providing a more robust framework for future enhancements and integrations."

## Motivation

"The current monolithic architecture of Talos restricts flexibility and hampers the integration of new features. By adopting a modular framework, developers will be able to deploy changes more efficiently, foster collaboration through smaller, isolated components, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs into the entire system."

## Specification

"This proposal outlines the following key elements of the modular architecture:
1. Component-based design: Each component will encapsulate specific functionality and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
2. Communication protocols: Define standardized interfaces and protocols for how components interact with one another.
3. Deployment strategies: Establish best practices for deploying updates to individual components without impacting the overall system."

## Rationale

"Transitioning to a modular architecture promotes code reusability and facilitates easier debugging and testing. By allowing teams to work on different modules concurrently, we can significantly reduce time-to-market for new features. Furthermore, as the Talos ecosystem grows, a modular structure will be essential to support diverse applications and integrations effectively."

## Security Considerations

"The modular architecture must include robust security practices at the component level. Each module should be designed with a focus on secure data handling, authentication, and authorization. Comprehensive security audits will be required during the development phase of each component to safeguard against vulnerabilities."

## Implementation

"Implementation will occur in three phases:
1. Design: Collaborate with stakeholders to create a blueprint for the modular architecture and define components.
2. Development: Create prototypes for key components and establish communication protocols.
3. Integration: Gradually replace monolithic components with newly developed modular ones, ensuring complete functionality at every stage."
