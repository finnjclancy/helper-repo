## Abstract

"This proposal outlines the introduction of a User Activity Dashboard that provides insights into user interactions, engagement levels, and system usage patterns, empowering users to better understand their engagement with the platform."

## Motivation

"With the increasing complexity of user interactions within the Talos platform, there is a need for users to have a clearer understanding of their activity. A User Activity Dashboard will facilitate better decision-making, improve user experience, and promote higher engagement."

## Specification

"The User Activity Dashboard will feature: 
1. Overview of user sessions, including duration and frequency
2. Insights into the most accessed features
3. Engagement metrics over time
4. Customizable views for users to focus on metrics that matter most to them."

## Rationale

"By equipping users with a detailed overview of their interactions, we address the need for greater transparency and ownership of their activity, which can lead to improved satisfaction and retention."

## Security Considerations

"User data privacy must be a top priority. The dashboard will anonymize and aggregate data to prevent exposure of any individualâ€™s sensitive information. Compliance with data protection regulations will be adhered to strictly."

## Implementation

"The implementation will involve:
1. UI/UX design phase to create a user-friendly interface.
2. Back-end development to pull data from user interactions.
3. Testing phase to ensure accuracy and performance.
4. Deployment with clear communication and guidance for users."
