## Abstract

"This TIP proposes a framework for decentralized identity management within the Talos ecosystem, aiming to enhance security and privacy. The framework will facilitate user control over personal data and reduce reliance on centralized identity providers."

## Motivation

"The growing concerns over data privacy and centralized identity systems necessitate a shift towards decentralized identity management. By implementing this framework, users can safeguard their information while accessing a wide range of services within the Talos ecosystem."

## Specification

"The proposed framework will utilize blockchain technology to ensure the immutability and security of identity records. It will outline the protocols for identity creation, validation, and verification, as well as user consent management."

## Rationale

"Decentralized identities empower users to own their data and engage with services without compromising their privacy. This aligns with the core values of the Talos community and fosters trust among its users."

## Security Considerations

"Security measures will include cryptographic techniques for data protection and protocols for ensuring user consent. The framework will also address potential threats such as identity theft and data breaches."

## Implementation

"The implementation will involve collaboration with developers and stakeholders within the Talos ecosystem to integrate the framework into existing services and provide user education on decentralized identity management." YUP
