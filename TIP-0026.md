## Abstract

"This TIP proposes an enhanced user authentication protocol for Talos, designed to improve security, user experience, and scalability. The new protocol leverages multi-factor authentication, encrypted token exchange, and a decentralized verification method to ensure that users can access their accounts safely and efficiently."

## Motivation

"With the increasing prevalence of cyber threats, it's essential that Talos implements a more robust authentication system. Current methods present vulnerabilities that can be exploited, leading to potential data breaches and user trust issues. By adopting a stronger protocol, we ensure user security, foster confidence, and maintain the integrity of the platform."

## Specification

"The proposed authentication protocol will consist of three main components: 
1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Users must provide at least two forms of verification (e.g., password and one-time code via SMS/email).
2. Encrypted Token Exchange: All authentication requests will utilize encrypted tokens to ensure secure transmission of user credentials.
3. Decentralized Verification: User identities will be verified through a decentralized network of nodes, reducing the risk of a single point of failure."

## Rationale

"This new approach not only aligns with industry best practices but also addresses specific concerns raised by users regarding account safety. By implementing MFA, we improve security against unauthorized access. The use of encrypted tokens prevents interception of sensitive data, while decentralized verification enhances resilience against attacks."

## Security Considerations

"The implementation of this enhanced protocol significantly mitigates risks associated with user authentication. However, it is crucial to monitor for new attack vectors targeting MFA delivery channels (e.g., SMS phishing) and to provide users with guidance on maintaining their account security."

## Implementation

"The protocol will be implemented in two phases: 
1. Phase 1 will involve integrating MFA and encrypted token exchange into the existing authentication system, aiming for a rollout within six months. 
2. Phase 2 will focus on developing the decentralized verification method, with a target completion date of twelve months from the start of Phase 1."
